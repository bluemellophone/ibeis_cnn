TODO:
    A model architecture should have a data-agnostic directory
    Allow multiple different datasets to train the same model
      * The adjustments that that model makes should be saved in a data-specific directory
    Show bad training examples

    Model Weight Tags
    Model Architecture Tags
    Dataset Tags
    Checkpoint Tag?

    * Training Babysitting:
    * Graph of weight magnitude updates - per layer as well
    * validation loss variance - per example -
    * determenistic loss ratios
    * loss ratios without weight decay

    * Baysian Hyperparamater optimization


HAVEDONE:
    * Combine datasets

    Data Metadata - Along with ability to go back and check the context of fail cases
    - need to use original SIFT descriptors from ibeis db if available

Ideas:
    Neural Network Vocabulary?
    Input a patch
    Output a word
    Training: unsupervised sparse autoencoder
